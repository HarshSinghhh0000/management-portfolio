                <p>
                    Hello! I'm <strong>Harsh Kumar</strong>, a dedicated individual with a passion for managing events and achieving excellence. 
                    Over the years, I've honed my skills in handling both official and unofficial events, ensuring their smooth execution and success. 
                    From coordinating inter-school competitions to leading impactful donation drives, my journey has been filled with meaningful experiences. 
                    I've had the privilege of managing numerous events that have not only enhanced my organizational abilities but also built my confidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My most memorable accomplishments include serving as a Cabinet Member during my school years, 
                    organizing large-scale events, and anchoring the prestigious NCC rank ceremony during my college days. 
                    I thrive in environments where creativity and responsibility come together to create unforgettable experiences.
                </p>
